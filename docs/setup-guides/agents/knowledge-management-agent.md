# Knowledge management agent

The FoundationaLLM (FLLM) knowledge management agent supports retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

The RAG flow augments the user prompt with additional context to generate a more accurate response. The RAG flow uses a retrieval model to retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base, such as a vector store, and then uses the retrieved documents to augment the user prompt before sending it to the LLM.

The creation of a Knowledge Management agent requires an existing knowledge base, such as a vector store. If it does not exist, use the [vectorization](../vectorization/index.md) API to create a vector store prior to the creation of the agent.

## Knowledge Management Agent Configuration

The Knowledge Management agent configuration may reference the following resources:

- [Vectorization text embedding profile](../vectorization/vectorization-profiles.md#text-embedding-profiles): The text embedding profile contains the configuration of the text embedding model used to embed the user prompt and perform a vector search in the knowledge base. This must match the text embedding profile used to index the knowledge base.

- [Vectorization indexing profile](../vectorization/vectorization-profiles.md#indexing-profiles): The indexing profile contains the configuration of the service hosting the index that is to be searched.

- [Prompt](prompt-resource.md): The system prompt of the agent, describing the persona of the agent.

>**Note**: The Knowledge Management agent implementation currently supports the [`AzureAISearchIndexer`](../vectorization/vectorization-profiles.html#azureaisearchindexer) indexing profile.

The structure of a Knowledge Management agent is the following:

## Managing Knowledge Management Agents

This section describes how to manage knowledge management agents using the Management API. `{{baseUrl}}` is the base URL of the Management API. `{{instanceId}}` is the unique identifier of the FLLM instance.

### Retrieve

```http
HTTP GET {{baseUrl}}/instances/{{instanceId}}/providers/FoundationaLLM.Agent/agents
```

### Create or update

```http
HTTP POST {{baseUrl}}/instances/{{instanceId}}/providers/FoundationaLLM.Agent/agents/<name>
Content-Type: application/json

BODY
<agent_configuration>
```

where `<agent_configuration>` is the JSON agent configuration structure described above.

### Delete

```http
HTTP DELETE {{baseUrl}}/instances/{{instanceId}}/providers/FoundationaLLM.Agent/agents/<name>
```

> [!NOTE]
> FLLM currently implements logical deletes for Knowledge Management agents. This means that users cannot create a Knowledge Management agent with the same name as a deleted Knowledge Management agent. Support for purging Knowledge Management agents will be added in a future release.

## Validating a Knowledge Management Agent

Once configured, the knowledge management agent can be validated using an API call to the [Core API](../exposed-apis/core-api.md) or via the [User Portal](../quickstart.md).

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 5 minutes for a new Knowledge Management agent to appear in the User Portal or be accessible for requests from the Core API.

## Overriding agent parameters

The agent parameters can be overridden at the time of the API call. Refer to the [Core API](../exposed-apis/core-api.md) documentation for more information.
